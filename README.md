# VLSI Circuit Design Course Projects

> This collection of course-based VLSI projects focuses on the foundational design, simulation, and analysis of CMOS logic circuits. It includes hands-on modeling of MOS transistors, inverter design, and implementation of basic logic gates such as NAND and NOR using TSMC 0.4¬µm technology in Cadence Virtuoso.

### üìå **Project Overview**
- **Objective:** To develop a practical understanding of CMOS digital circuit design, emphasizing SPICE modeling, delay optimization, and layout-aware considerations in VLSI systems.
- **Methodology:** The project started with transistor-level SPICE modeling of NMOS and PMOS devices. Device parameters were extracted from DC simulation plots. Using these models, inverters were designed and optimized for speed and power. The project concluded with the implementation and timing analysis of 2-input NAND and NOR gates.
